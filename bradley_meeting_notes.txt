Questions:
* I'm taking all unique ownnames instead of iterating line by line. Okay to
  make a new two column spreadsheet saying which gave back none or more than
  one result?
* I'm seeing multiple pdfs. Which one do you want, or do you want all?

filename = <ownname>.pdf

Don't need to add to the spreadsheet.
Just make a flag-list where one column is the ownname for ownnames for which
there is zero or more than one result, and a column for the flag. Or just
one column list of ownnames.

/* Leave this for now and do at a later time after talking with Brad
Search queries must have one of three things:
Anything that's an llc has one of three things in the name:
1.  
2. 
3. 
*/

Question 2:
* Grab all pdfs, get doc type, and file date. Make filename (ownname +
  doctype + filedate).pdf
